# AORMS Cloud Roadmap (aorms.in / production)

**Status:** ACTIVE — soft launch, sign-in now live on the landing page;
Next.js/Supabase stack migration **in progress** (Phase 1 done)  
**Updated:** 2026-09-04  
**Scope:** What ships to the **production VPS** (`aorms.in`) and when — deployment
status, feature rollout to the live office hub, and cloud infrastructure.

## Stack migration — Next.js + Supabase (in progress)

Full spec: [NEXTJS-SUPABASE-MIGRATION.md](./NEXTJS-SUPABASE-MIGRATION.md).

**Target:** Next.js + TypeScript + Carbon Design System + Supabase, replacing
the current React SPA + tRPC + Fastify + raw PostgreSQL + Python worker stack.
Deployment target moves from the VPS (`compose.prod.yaml`) to Hostinger
Managed App Hosting; Supabase replaces self-hosted PostgreSQL/auth/storage.
**The current production stack stays live and unchanged** until a phase below
is merged and verified — the `web/` package is new, additive code; nothing in
`frontend`/`backend` has been touched by this migration yet.

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Target-architecture spec written | ✅ [NEXTJS-SUPABASE-MIGRATION.md](./NEXTJS-SUPABASE-MIGRATION.md) |
| Repo audit — Phase 2 domains (map current tRPC procedures / Fastify routes / components to Next.js equivalents — see spec § 36–37) | ✅ [NEXTJS-MIGRATION-PHASE2-AUDIT.md](./NEXTJS-MIGRATION-PHASE2-AUDIT.md) — surfaced and resolved a blocking decision (single-tenant per deployment, no `org_id`, decided 2026-09-04). Later phases (3–7) get their own audit pass when their turn comes. |
| **Phase 1 — Foundation** (Next.js + TS + Carbon + Supabase + auth + app shell) | ✅ **Complete, connected to a live Supabase project.** `web/` package — Next.js 16 + Carbon + `@supabase/ssr` wired end-to-end (client/server/proxy), Server Action sign-in/sign-out, Carbon `AppShell` (Header+SideNav), `(auth)/login` + `(app)/dashboard` route groups. `next build --webpack` clean, `eslint web` 0/0. Sign-in verified live through the browser against the real project (landing → Supabase Auth session → Server Component → Carbon shell), including confirming Carbon's classes/CSS vars/IBM Plex font all apply correctly (an initial "looks unstyled" impression was just Carbon's flat `white` theme, not a bug). |
| Phase 2 — Core ERP (orgs, users, roles, clients, projects, tasks) | 🚧 Migration `0001_phase2_core.sql` **applied to the live project** (user ran it via the SQL Editor — direct DB access still isn't available from a session: Supabase's direct connection is IPv6-only and this network has no IPv6 route, confirmed while trying). `profiles`/`audit_log`/`firm`/`clients`/`project_offices`/`phases`/`tasks` all exist with RLS live. **`/clients` slice verified end-to-end against real data**: signed in, created "Sharma Residences LLP" through the actual UI, confirmed it persisted or reloaded, and confirmed `write_audit()` logged the CREATE with full before/after — the whole read+write+audit+RLS pattern is proven, not just built. Remaining: `project_offices`/`phases` and `tasks` UI + actions — see current assignment below. |
| Phase 3 — Commercial (proposals, quotations, contracts, invoices, payments) | 🔲 |
| Phase 4 — Technical (estimation, BOQ, measurements, documents, drawings) | 🔲 |
| Phase 5 — Reporting (dashboards, reports, exports, analytics) | 🔲 |
| Phase 6 — Advanced processing (PDF/DWG, Python worker) | 🔲 |
| Phase 7 — Optional AI | 🔲 |

**Known gotcha (documented in `web/next.config.ts`):** Next 16's default
Turbopack can't resolve `@carbon/styles`' internal Sass `@use` imports
through pnpm's symlinked `node_modules` — `web/package.json`'s dev/build
scripts force `--webpack` until that's fixed upstream.

**Tenancy decided (2026-09-04): single-tenant per deployment** — no `org_id`
anywhere, RLS scoped by `auth.uid()` + role only.

**Cloud-agent assignment:** the remaining Phase 2 work (`project_offices`/
`phases` UI + Server Actions, then `tasks`) is the current cloud-agent task —
branch as `cloud-agent/phase2-projects-tasks` off a freshly-pulled `main` and
follow [CLOUD-AGENT-WORKFLOW.md](./CLOUD-AGENT-WORKFLOW.md) exactly (branch
naming, do/don't, self-verification, handoff — local verifies and merges,
cloud-agent does not merge to `main`).

---

## Current phase — soft launch

Per [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) § Launch status:

| Surface | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `/` (landing page) | ✅ **Live** — pure architecture-practice messaging, no blog (removed 2026-09) |
| `/#sign-in` (sign in / create workspace / reset password) | ✅ **Live** — embedded on the landing page (`LandingAuth`), not gated behind `VITE_MARKETING_ONLY` |
| `/login`, `/access`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` | ✅ Redirect to `/#sign-in` |
| `/downloads` | Web-only, no installers |
| `/wiki*` | ✅ Redirects home (no wiki surfaces) |
| `/account`, `/company-account`, `/platform-admin`, `/demo` | 🔲 Still behind `VITE_MARKETING_ONLY` |

**S8 (reopen apex sign-in) is done** — superseded by folding sign-in directly
into the landing page rather than reopening the old dedicated `/login` page.
`VITE_MARKETING_ONLY` still gates the smaller remaining surface above.

**Ops step still needed:** deploy the current `main` to the VPS — the
landing-page sign-in, blog removal, and EOMS/consultancy removal are all
committed but this session has no VPS/deploy credentials to push them live.

## CI / build health ✅ (2026-09-04)

**History:** `main` HEAD's CI was fully broken at the install step
(`ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` — `frontend/package.json` had drifted from
`pnpm-lock.yaml`, missing `@carbon/react` and misdeclaring `react-router-dom`
against the root `pnpm.overrides` security pin), then, once that was fixed
and `cloud-agent` merged into `main`, the merge itself surfaced 72
pre-existing TypeScript errors and 1 pre-existing ESLint error across ~20
files that had never actually been typechecked green (root causes: half-
finished Carbon migrations, MUI v9 API drift, renamed contract fields, dead
code referencing removed desktop/allied-app concepts).

**Current state, verified locally (2026-09-04):**

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend` `tsc --noEmit` | ✅ 0 errors |
| `backend` `tsc --noEmit` | ✅ 0 errors |
| `packages/contracts` `tsc --noEmit` | ✅ 0 errors |
| `eslint .` (repo-wide) | ✅ 0 errors (5 pre-existing `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings remain) |
| `frontend` `vitest run` | ✅ 63/63 passing |
| `backend` `vitest run` | ✅ 209/209 passing |
| `vite build` | ✅ succeeds |
| `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` | ✅ 0 high/critical (was 12) — 2 moderate remain, deliberately unfixed, see below |
| `worker` `pytest` | ⬜ not verified — no Python interpreter on the machine that ran this pass |

**Dependency audit — fixed (2026-09-04):** all 12 high-severity findings
resolved via direct version bumps (`pdfjs-dist` `6.1.200`→`6.3.289`,
`fastify` `^5.10.0`→`^5.12.3`, `dompurify` `^3.4.11`→`^3.4.14`) and root
`pnpm.overrides` (`fast-uri` → `>=3.1.6 <4.0.0 || >=4.1.3` — a compound range
because a bare `>=3.1.6` wouldn't force-bump an already-resolved `4.1.2`,
which itself satisfies `>=3.1.6`; `nanoid` → `>=3.3.18`; `browserslist` →
`>=4.28.7`; `postcss` → `>=8.5.23`). Verified: `tsc`/`eslint`/`vitest`/
`vite build` all still green after the bumps.

**Deliberately left unfixed — 2 moderate findings**, both nested under
`backend > minio@8.0.7`, minio's *latest* release: `stream-json@1.9.1`
(needs `>=3.5.0`, a **major** bump) and `query-string@7.1.3 >
decode-uri-component@0.2.2` (needs `>=0.5.0`, which is pure-ESM-only —
`query-string@7.1.3` has no `"type": "module"` of its own, so a `require()`
of it would break). minio 8.0.7 itself still declares
`"stream-json": "^1.8.0"` — forcing a major-version override risks breaking
minio's internal JSON parsing (S3 client) silently, with no way to
integration-test the fix on this machine (no live MinIO/Podman stack). Both
are moderate DoS findings on a narrow attack surface (malformed S3 responses
/ crafted percent-encoded input) — revisit once minio ships a release that
adopts newer majors of these, or if someone can verify against a live stack.

**Still open:**

- 5 `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings (not errors) in
  `ProjectMeasurementPanel.tsx`, `JointMeasurementRecorder.tsx`,
  `ProjectMoodboard.tsx`, `UsageReportsTab.tsx`, `KnowledgeBankPortal.tsx`.
- Worker `pytest` needs running on a machine with Python to confirm.
